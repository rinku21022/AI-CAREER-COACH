## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### **Modern React Patterns**
```javascript
// Server Components (default)
export default async function DashboardPage() {
  const data = await fetchServerData()
  return <Dashboard data={data} />
}

// Client Components (when needed)
'use client'
export default function InteractiveForm() {
  const [state, setState] = useState('')
  return <form>...</form>
}
```

### **Server Actions**
```javascript
// actions/resume.js
export async function createResume(formData) {
  const { userId } = auth()
  
  const resume = await prisma.resume.create({
    data: { userId, ...formData }
  })
  
  revalidatePath('/resume')
  return resume
}
```

### **AI Integration**
```javascript
// lib/ai-helper.js
export async function generateContent(prompt) {
  const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: "gemini-pro" })
  const result = await model.generateContent(prompt)
  return result.response.text()
}
```

### **Background Jobs**
```javascript
// lib/inngest/functions.js
export const enhanceResume = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "enhance-resume" },
  { event: "resume.enhance" },
  async ({ event }) => {
    // Process AI enhancement in background
  }
)
```

## 🎪 Common Interview Questions

### **Q: "Walk me through your project architecture"**
**A**: "This is a modern full-stack application built with Next.js 15 and React 19. The architecture follows a layered approach with Server Components for performance, Server Actions for form handling, Prisma for type-safe database access, and Inngest for background processing. The AI features are powered by Google's Gemini API..."

### **Q: "How do you handle state management?"**
**A**: "I use a hybrid approach - Server Components handle server state, React's built-in useState/useReducer for local component state, and Clerk's context for authentication state. This eliminates the need for complex state management libraries while maintaining good performance..."

### **Q: "What about error handling and monitoring?"**
**A**: "I implement error handling at multiple levels - React error boundaries for component errors, try-catch blocks in Server Actions, Prisma error handling for database operations, and graceful degradation for AI service failures. I also use Vercel Analytics for monitoring..."
