  async ({ event, step }) => {
    const resume = await step.run("get-resume", () => 
      prisma.resume.findUnique({ where: { id: event.data.resumeId } })
    );
    
    const enhanced = await step.run("ai-enhance", () => 
      generateEnhancedContent(resume.content)
    );
    
    await step.run("update-resume", () => 
      prisma.resume.update({

- "All AI operations are handled server-side for security"
- "Background jobs prevent UI blocking during AI processing"

### **3. User Experience**
- "The interface is responsive and accessible"
- "Form validation provides immediate feedback"
- "Loading states keep users informed during operations"

### **4. Performance**
- "Next.js automatic optimizations like code splitting"
- "Image optimization with the Next.js Image component"

## 🤔 Difficult Questions & Answers

### Q: "How would you scale this application?"
**A**: "I'd implement several strategies:
- **Database**: Use read replicas for better performance
- **Caching**: Redis for session and API response caching
- **CDN**: CloudFront for static assets
- **Monitoring**: Datadog or New Relic for performance monitoring
- **Background Jobs**: Inngest already handles horizontal scaling
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement API rate limiting to prevent abuse"

### Q: "What are the biggest challenges you faced?"
**A**: "The main challenges were:
- **AI Rate Limits**: Implemented queuing with Inngest to handle API limits
- **State Management**: Balancing server and client state with Server Actions
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable
- **Performance**: Optimizing for both initial load and interactive performance"

### Q: "How do you handle errors in production?"
**A**: "I have multiple error handling layers:
- **Client-side**: Error boundaries for React components
- **Server-side**: Try-catch blocks in Server Actions
- **Database**: Prisma error handling with meaningful messages
- **AI API**: Fallback content when AI service is unavailable
- **Monitoring**: Vercel Analytics for tracking errors in production"

### Q: "What would you improve with more time?"
**A**: "Several areas for improvement:
- **Real-time Features**: WebSocket integration for live collaboration
- **Advanced AI**: Fine-tuned models for better domain-specific content
- **Analytics**: User behavior tracking and A/B testing
- **Mobile App**: React Native version for mobile users
- **Internationalization**: Multi-language support
- **Advanced Security**: SOC2 compliance features"

## 📝 Code Snippets to Have Ready

### **Server Action with Error Handling**
```javascript
export async function createResume(formData) {
  try {
    const { userId } = auth();
    
    const validatedData = resumeSchema.parse(formData);
    
    const resume = await prisma.resume.create({
      data: {
        userId,
        ...validatedData
      }
    });
    
    await inngest.send({ 
      name: "resume.created", 
      data: { resumeId: resume.id } 
    });
    
    revalidatePath('/resume');
    return { success: true, resume };
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Resume creation failed:', error);
    return { success: false, error: error.message };
  }
}
```

### **Middleware Configuration**
```javascript
export default clerkMiddleware((auth, req) => {
  const { userId } = auth();
  
  if (isProtectedRoute(req) && !userId) {
    return auth().redirectToSignIn();
  }
  
  if (isOnboardingRequired(req, userId)) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/onboarding', req.url));
  }
});
```

### **Component with Suspense**
```javascript
export default function ResumePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Suspense fallback={<ResumeSkeleton />}>
        <ResumeList />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
```
